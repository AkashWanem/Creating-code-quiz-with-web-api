# Creating-code-quiz-with-web-api
Description: On this task i had to create Quiz code using apis. I had to code everything from scratch Html, Css and javascript. The quiz is a multiple choice questions, answers about javascript fundamentals. we had to create a button that will start the quiz. As i press the start quiz button the timer on the top-right will start the countdown, the user has 15 seconds for each questions and will be penalised 15s everytime they get the question wrong. At the end the user is given their score and asked for their initials, which they can submit. The score will be recorded in the local storage so users can see who are in the leaderboard.
